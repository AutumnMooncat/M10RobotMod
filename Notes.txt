Rework Ideas

Form card doing overclocks isn't a great idea. Maybe replace with a different idea?

Perhaps let overclocking be permanent for scaling but nerf the cards that overclock?

Cards to Make:

-Orb Upgrades-
Maybe 1 more Orb Upgrade card (There are currently 3)

-Swappable-

Missing Slots: 0
Missing many Branching Upgrades

? (?) - Whenever you Upgrade an Orb...
? (?) - Whenever you Overclock a card...
? (?) - Whenever you Channel an Orb...
? (?) - Whenever you Evoke an Orb...
? (?) - Upgrade the first ? Orbs you Channel each combat.
Bottled ? (Uncommon) - Choose a card. Whenever you play it... (Spikes, Channel, Overclock, Upgrade)

Branching Ideas:
Thorn Field - Make branching to give more Spikes?
Brief Respite / Quick Thinking - Branch for Extract?

Card Reworks:
Evasion Down - Watch for balance, might be too strong
Byte / Nibble - Needs balance, currently too strong
Wide Angle - Move to Rare? It's really strong.
Overdrive Form - Too strong?
Engage - Too strong as a 0 cost channel card? Especially with Extract mechanics
Booster - Feels bad to play as a 2 cost for the effect it gives
Heuristics - Branch is bad
Byte / Nibble - Both too strong and too weak at the same time. Nibble needs a better effect

Unstable Compound - Channel random Orb and upgrade it? Would need new Bomb channeling card.
Atomize - rework? Make X cost channel X Bomb [Not Exhaust].
Assembly Line - rework? - At the start of your turn, Channel a random Orb?

Card Addons:
If this is the only ? in your hand...
If first card played...
If unblocked damage... (Scrape Off / Inversion Beam)
If target has Vulnerable / Lock-On... (Seeker)
If you Extracted this turn...

Card Ideas:
Whenever you Extract...
Whenever you apply Lock-On...
Whenever you attack an enemy with Lock-On...
