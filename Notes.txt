Rework Ideas

Overclocking needs an improvement to how its calculated and applied

Present Orbs are silly and need to be reworked

Bomb Orb - Stores damage when you are attacked, evokes to deal damage?

Momentum - See how it feels

If Momentum is implemented, rework Scrambled to be stackable in cards reduced as well as turns

Aimed modifier vs Spiky Modifier - Are they balanced against each other? Aimed is a free +50% damage; Spiky can scale infinitely, but drops off when attacked due to losing Spikes

Upgrading Orbs is probably too strong

There's no Orb Slot increase and no Focus, is this okay though?

Orbs are maybe too strong in general. Bit being base 2 damage means that it deals 3 damage per attack with Lock-On. Bomb being base 5 damage means it deals 7 damage per turn to ALL enemies with Lock-On.

Archetypes:
Lock-On
Components
Turtle (Thorns/Spikes, Reflection)
Heavy Assault (Recoil, Reloading, Multihits)
