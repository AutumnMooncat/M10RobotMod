Rework Ideas

Overclocking needs an improvement to how its calculated and applied. Overclock applying cards can give weird % values, which isnt great.

Form card doing overclocks isnt a great idea. Maybe replace with a different idea?

Present Orbs are silly and need to be reworked

Momentum - See how it feels?

Riposte - See how it feels?

If Momentum is implemented, rework Scrambled to be stackable in cards reduced as well as turns

Aimed modifier vs Spiky Modifier - Are they balanced against each other? Aimed is a free +50% damage; Spiky can scale infinitely, but drops off when attacked due to losing Spikes

Spikes are probably too strong

Upgrading Orbs is probably too strong

There's no Orb Slot increase and no Focus, is this okay though?

Orbs are maybe too strong in general?

Present Orb rework into Block or defensive style? Ideas: Block on Card Play. Plated Armor shenanigans?

Archetypes:
Lock-On
Turtle (Thorns/Spikes, Reflection)
Heavy Assault (Recoil, Reloading, Multihits)
