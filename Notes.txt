Rework Ideas

Form card doing overclocks isnt a great idea. Maybe replace with a different idea?

Momentum - See how it feels?

Riposte - See how it feels?

If Momentum is implemented, rework Scrambled to be stackable in cards reduced as well as turns

Aimed modifier vs Spiky Modifier - Are they balanced against each other? Aimed is a free +50% damage; Spiky can scale infinitely, but drops off when attacked due to losing Spikes

Spikes are probably too strong

Upgrading Orbs is probably too strong

There's no Orb Slot increase and no Focus, is this okay though?

Orbs are maybe too strong in general?

Present Orb implementation too strong as both cards give them upgrades out of the box.

Cards to make:

-Orb Upgrades-
Maybe 1 more Orb Upgrade card (There are currently 3)

-Swappable-
? - ?
? - ?
? - ?

-Stasis-
? - ?
? - ?

-Other-
1-2 Cards with Reshuffle?
