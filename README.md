# M10 Robot Mod

_**aka Even More Orange Juice The Spire**_


This mod currently adds M10 Robot from the game 100% Orange Juice.

Alongside them is a full suite of 75 cards that are not guaranteed to play well with other mods. I did my best. While I do not yet know of any incompatibilities, please let me know if you find any.

Character, relic, and some card assets are from 100% Orange Juice and are property of Orange_Juice and Fruitbat Factory. The remaining cards were drawn by me in my best attempt to immitate the original art style.

This mod is a work in progress, but it is still a fully playable (if not balanced) experience at the moment.

Features

_**Overclocking:**_
As one of the main mechanics available in the draft, Overclocking cards allows them to temporarily showcase much stronger effects than usual. Represented with a percentile above the name, Overclocking a card increases all relevant values on a card by the shown percent. While a Defend might give 5 Block, a 200% Defend will give 10. This increase is not limited to only damage and Block. A card that channels 2 Orbs that is raised to 150% will channel 3, and a card that deals 4 damage 2 times will see a drastic improvement of dealing 6 damage 3 times when overclocked to 150%. Overclocking is performed in steps of 25% increases, however, this boost only lasts until the card is played, at which point the card will return to normal.

_**Spikes:**_
M10 Robot is a character who can deal heavy damage to enemies while being attacked. Armed with Spikes, a new Thorns-lite power, M10 can deal damage back to attackers each time they are hit. In addition, there are cards that are considered Spiky, meaning they deal extra damage for each Spike you have. As a downside, Spikes are lost at the start of your turn once you are attacked. This means that should a turn pass where you are not attacked, Spikes will not be lost.

_**Lock-On:**_
While Defect has a single card for applying Lock-On, M10 Robot has multiple ways to apply it. Aside from being useful for Orbs, there are synergistic cards that have extra effects should the target of the card have Lock-On. In addition, 3 of the 4 Orbs available are damage dealing Orbs, meaning that Lock-On can almost always be a valuable asset.

_**Extraction:**_
Providing M10 Robot with a strong way to control the flow of cards, Extracting is a mechanic that draws cards from the top of the discard pile, rather than the draw pile. This can allow for strategic playing of the same card multiple times per turn, as well as enabling certain cards that have extra effects if they were already played this turn.

_**Orb Upgrades:**_
As M10's Orbs are on average stronger than Defect's Orbs, M10 does not have access to Focus in its draft. To compensate, M10 has access to Orb Upgrades. These upgrades are on an Orb by Orb basis, unlike Focus, which means that when an upgraded Orb is evoked, the new Orb taking its spot does not get the boost. As an upside, Orb Upgrades are generally stronger than a single Focus would be. In addition, all basegame Orbs and many modded Orbs are supported, should you get access to another character's Orbs mid run, or should another Character get access to M10's Orb Upgrade cards!

_**Orbs:**_ 
While M10 Robot uses the same Orb system as Defect, they have their own 4 unique Orbs to play with (though Defect's Orbs will still work if you use Prismatic Shard). All of M10s Orbs have animations, and will react to various conditions such as attacking or M10 being damaged.

_Searchlight Orb_ - This allows M10 to play a more turtled playstyle. Each time you are attacked, this Orbs deals 2 damage back to the attacker, like Thorns. When evoked it provides 3 Spikes, allowing it to have a solid position in most Spikes and Reflect Damage builds. 

_Bit Orb_ - In constract to Searchlight, this Orb is attentive to the player attacking, rather than being attacked. Each time you play an Attack, it deals 2 damage to the enemy with the lowest HP, helping finish them off. When Evoked, the Bit instead targets a random enemy, dealing 4 damage and applying 2 Lock-On. The application of Lock-On allows bits to have a self sustaining damage increase, as well as fitting nicely into Lock-On archetype builds.

_Bomb Orb_ - Designed as a spin on Dark Orbs, Bombs start with 6 damage when they are channeled. Each time you are attacked, the Bomb increases its stored damage by a percent of the inbound damage. When evoked, this stored up damage is dealt to the enemy with the most HP, helping you take down big threats.

_Present Orb_ - Solidifying M10's draw power, Presents are about as difficult to get as Plasma is for Defect. Presents increase M10's start of turn draw by 1, and when evoked, draw 2 cards.
