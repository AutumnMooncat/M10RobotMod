# M10 Robot Mod

_**aka Even More Orange Juice The Spire**_


This mod currently adds M10 Robot from the game 100% Orange Juice.

Alongside them is a full suite of 75+ cards that are not guaranteed to play well with other mods. I did my best. While I do not yet know of any incompatibilities, please let me know if you find any.

Character and some card assets are from 100% Orange Juice and are property of Orange_Juice and Fruitbat Factory. The remaining cards were drawn by me in my best attempt to immitate the original art style.

This mod is a work in progress, but it is still a fully playable (if not balanced) experience at the moment. Additional relics are planned, and new cards may be added in the future.

Features

_New Card Types:_ 
M10 Robot comes with 2 new card classifications. Alongside Attack, Skill, and Power, there are now Boosters and Modules. These 2 card types are unplayable, but may be equipped via Right Clicking them. Modules attach to the player while Boosters attach to cards.

_Boosters:_
Booster cards come in 2 flavors: Extra Effect, and Value Modification, and can be used to alter how cards perform and function. Extra Effects add additional text and functionality to cards, while Value Modification increases the preexisting values on a card. An example of an Extra Effect would be "Modification: Draw 1 card". Once attached to a Defend, the Defend would now read: "Gain 5 Block. Draw 1 card.". An Example of a Value Modification would be "Modification: +4 Block". Once attached to the same Defend, it would now read "Gain 9 Block. Draw 1 card".". Cards with Boosters equipped will have a unique animation play and will have the card name color changed. Normal cards are White, upgraded cards are Green, boosted cards are Blue, and upgraded boosted cards are Purple. There is no limit to the amount of Boosters that can be applied to a single card.

_Modules:_ 
M10 Robot has few Power cards, but they have many Module cards. Modules may be equipped on the player and act similar to powers, however, there are limitations to how many can be equipped at a time. M10 Robots second starter relic allows them to spawn with 4 Module Slots. Modules can be unequipped, discarding them in the process, if you need to change what Modules you are using on the fly.

_Orbs:_ 
While M10 Robot uses the same Orb system as Defect, they have their own 4 unique Orbs to play with (though Defect Orbs will still work if you use Prismatic Shard). All of M10s Orbs have animations, and will react to various conditions such as attacking or M10 being damaged.

_Searchlight Orb_ - This allows M10 to play a more turtled playstyle. Each time you are attacked (so it triggers multiple times for multihits), this Orbs deals 2 damage back to the attacker, like Thorns. When evoked, it causes ALL enemies to lose HP, directly bypassing Block. Searchlight is effected by Focus, which will increase the recoil and evoke damages accordingly. 

_Bit Orb_ - In constract to Searchlight, this Orb is attentive to the player attacking, rather than being attacked. Each time you cause an attack on an enemy (triggering multiple times for AOE and multhits), this orb will do 1 damage to the target. What constitutes you causing an attack on the enemy is fairly encompassing, as things like Searchlight Orbs firing and poison damage activating both count as attacks you perform and will activate Bit Orb. When evoked, it deals damage to a random enemy equal to the total damage it has dealt with it's passive effect. Bit is effected by Focus, which will increase the amount of damage dealt by the passive effect.

_Bomb Orb_ - The polar opposite of the Dark Orb. This Orb when evoked deals 20 damage to ALL enemies, however, its passive effect lowers the damage that the evoke will do by 2 each turn. This allows for a different playstyle where trying to Evoke the orbs as quickly as possible will be the most rewarding option. Bomb Orb is effected by Focus, which will lower the damage decrease, eventually cancelling it out. Enough Focus will instead make Bomb Orbs increase in damage each turn!

_Present Orb_ - An orb that is closer to a factory that has no combat capabilities. When channeled, Presents choose a random Booster card and slowly assmble it. Presents have a 40% assembly rate, and this amount is added to the current progress at the beginning of your turn. Once progress hits 100%, it rolls over (keeping any overflow, so 120% rolls over to 20% progress) and adds the Booster to your hand. It then begins work on a new random Booster. The Booster that will be added to your hand can be previewed by hovering over the Orb. When evoked, assembly finishes immediately, skipping the assembly time. Present is effected by Focus, which increases the assembly rate. Assembly rates greater or equal to 100% guarentee a booster every turn!
